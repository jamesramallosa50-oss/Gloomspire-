# Gloomspire

Static game: `index.html` is the whole game. No build step.

## One-time setup
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload everything in this folder (drag and drop works on github.com).
2. Go to vercel.com/new, pick "Import Git Repository", and choose that repo.
3. Leave Framework Preset as "Other". Leave Build Command and Output Directory empty. Click Deploy.

## Updating the game
Replace `index.html` in the repo with the new version (on github.com: open the file, click the pencil/upload, commit).
Vercel redeploys automatically within a minute and keeps the same link.
## What changed in this version
- **Graphics**: sharper 64px stone textures with bevelled seams, baked corner shading, brighter and longer-reaching torchlight with halos, shadows under creatures, a light colour grade and vignette (off on the Low setting).
- **Climb balance**: enemies have less health, hit softer and move a little slower, packs are smaller, elites are rarer, levelling is faster, flasks drop more often, and a fall costs a third of your levels instead of half. Tune it in `DIFF`, `spawnEnemy` and the `budget` line in `buildLevel0`.
- **New enemies**: Powder Goblin (floor 2+, explodes), Ghoul (floor 3+, pounces), Frost Shaman (floor 4+, slows you), Bone Chanter (floor 6+, heals its allies).
- **Roomier floors**: rooms are about 1.5x larger, corridors are two lanes wide, and big rooms get pillars.
- **PvP battlegrounds**: the Arena, Stadium and Crossing are much larger, and there is a new map, the Scaffold. They have blocks, ledges and catwalks to climb, jump pads, speed strips, linked gates and power orbs. Layouts live in `genArena`.
- **Fixes**: the final boss no longer errors when he casts Orb, fusing Last Gate with Haste and stepping through a Gate of Ascension no longer throw, and the title backdrop no longer crashes when a room reconnects during a match.

Everyone in a multiplayer room needs this same version, because floor layouts changed.
